A simple model for simulating C. elegans embryonic development based on DNA barcoded scRNA-seq data.

The model is based on a Birth-Death process and a GTR model of nucleotide substitution. It has been implemented in RevBayes.

The `python` folder contains tools implemented in python for analyzing the output of the model. Currently it only contains a script for summarizing/comparing pairwise lineage distances from different lineage trees.
